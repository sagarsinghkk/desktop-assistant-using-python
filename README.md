** Desktop Voice Assistant using Python**

Developed a feature-rich desktop voice assistant application using Python, incorporating speech recognition, text-to-speech, and AI-driven conversation capabilities. Key functionalities include:

- **Speech Recognition:** Implemented using the `speech_recognition` library for real-time voice command interpretation.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Utilized `pyttsx3` for converting text responses to speech, enhancing user interaction.
- **OpenAI Integration:** Integrated OpenAI's API to generate intelligent and context-aware responses.
- **Voice Commands:** Enabled functionalities such as web browsing, playing music, checking time, and launching applications based on voice inputs.
- **Graphical User Interface:** Optional GUI implementation for enhanced user experience.
- **Platform Compatibility:** Ensured cross-platform functionality with specific adaptations for Windows using `sapi5`.

**Technical Skills:**
- Python Programming
- Speech Recognition and Synthesis
- API Integration
- Software Development (Desktop Applications)
- Machine Learning (NLP with OpenAI)

This project showcases expertise in developing interactive and intelligent voice-driven applications, leveraging Python's versatile libraries and APIs for creating practical, user-friendly software solutions.
